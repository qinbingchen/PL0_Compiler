# This hand-written assembly program calculates the first K values of the fibonacci sequence.
# Initially, the memory address count: contains K.

# Firstly we JMP to main, because the execution starts at offset 0
	JMP main
# This contains f[n]
m:
	1
# This contains f[n+1]
n:
	1

# The number of iterations to calculate
count:
	20

# The main function which is a loop to generate the next Fibonacci number.
main:
	LOAD m
	PRINT
	LOAD n
	ADD
	LOAD n
	SAVE m
	SAVE n

# Decrement the counter
	PUSH 1
	LOAD count
	SUB
	DUP
	SAVE count
	JLT main
